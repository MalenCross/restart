1. **Gross Income**
   * Begin with your total wages, tips, and other compensation from Box 1 of your W-2.

2. **Adjustments to Income (Above-the-Line Deductions)**
   * Subtract any adjustments to income that you qualify for. Common adjustments include contributions to a traditional IRA (subject to limits), student loan interest, and educator expenses.
   * The result after these subtractions is your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).

3. **Choose Standard or Itemized Deductions**
   * From your AGI, you will subtract either the standard deduction or your itemized deductions (whichever is greater).
   * The standard deduction varies based on your filing status (e.g., Single, Married Filing Jointly).
   * If you have significant deductible expenses like mortgage interest, state and local taxes (subject to a cap), and charitable contributions, itemizing might be more beneficial.

4. **Calculate Taxable Income**
   * Taxable income = AGI - (Standard Deduction or Itemized Deductions).

5. **Calculate Preliminary Tax**
   * Use the IRS Tax Tables or Tax Rate Schedules provided in the instructions for Form 1040 to determine your tax based on your taxable income.

6. **Credits**
   * Subtract any tax credits you qualify for. Common credits include the Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Credit (EIC), and the American Opportunity Credit for education.
   * Credits directly reduce the amount of tax you owe.

7. **Other Taxes**
   * If applicable, add any additional taxes, such as the alternative minimum tax or taxes on early withdrawals from IRAs or retirement plans.

8. **Withholdings and Payments**
   * Determine your total federal income tax withheld for the year from Box 2 of your W-2.
   * If you made estimated tax payments or had overpayment credits from a prior year, add them to the withheld amount.

9. **Determine Refund or Amount Owed**
   * If the total of your withholdings and payments (from step 8) is more than your tax liability (from step 7), you'll get a refund.
   * If the total of your withholdings and payments is less than your tax liability, you'll owe the difference.

10. **File Your Tax Return**
   * Using the above calculations, you can fill out and file your Form 1040 with the IRS. If you owe tax, you'll need to pay it by the filing deadline (typically April 15th) to avoid penalties and interest. If you're owed a refund, the IRS will send it to you after processing your return.

Remember, the U.S. tax code is complex, and the above steps are a generalized overview. Many details and potential situations aren't covered here. For specific advice or assistance, it's wise to consult with a tax professional or use tax software that guides you through the process.
